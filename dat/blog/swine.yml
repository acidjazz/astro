  description: Studio Swine is collaboration between Japanese Architect Azusa Murakami and British Artist Alexander Groves. Their work spans across disciplines of art, design and film exploring themes of regional identity and the future of resourcing materials in context of globalization. Swineâ€™s work dives deep into the research of common everyday materials exploring alternative methods to produce unique objects while practicing sustainability. From the plastic filled oceans to deforestation, each project fundamentally challenges the way we produce and dispose products. Their work not only taught me how important it is to understand the life cycle of the products we design but also to be conscious of how products are built and inevitably disassembled. I believe sustainability should be a part of a larger conversation between clients and manufacturers and become prioritized throughout the design process.
