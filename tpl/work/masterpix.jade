    .title Brand Design
    .copy Our work began with the brand design. We built the Masterpix brand to be as premium and intelligent as the product. That meant creating an astute, modern visual identity and photographic style, building a sharp online experience and following it up with packaging that does the product justice.

    .title Logo and Wordmark
    .copy The double-square logo evokes the multi-stage process of affixing an image to a pane of glass while also calling to mind a picture frame. While the light line weight of the logo and wordmark is inspired by the strength and thinness of Gorilla glass.
