.copy The Broad has an impressive collection of influential artists from the 1950s to the present. The first floor featured present day artists with paintings and sculptures by Yayoi Kusama and Takashi Murakami. Perhaps my favorite thing there was Kusama's Infinity Room, a small mirror-lined room with hanging LED lights that seemed endless.

People will think you’re cool.<br /><br /> If you plan to visit, make reservations online to avoid long wait times. The infinite room has an especially long line because space is limited.
