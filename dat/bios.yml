    name: Brett Lovelady
    position: Founder & CEO
    bio: "Brett Lovelady is a designer, communicator and angst ridden creative capitalist. After receiving his BFA in Design at BYU, he escaped to Silicon Valley to design the future. After his successful run as Vice President of Design at Lunar and Frog respectively, he sought absolute power (aka responsibility) and unbridled creative license. This led him to the founding of Astro Studios in 1994, and it’s been a giant fun-filled waterslide of bringing innovative products to market, turning venturous sparks into fireballs, and becoming a global design voice. \n\nBrett’s favorite pastime is family time with a dash of sports and music to take the edge off. And if he gets the chance, a lap in his classic Mustang ragtop recharges him to pursue the next big thing. "

    name: Kyle Swen
    position: EVP & Partner
    bio: Kyle’s is the creative spark of Astro. Born in Minnesota, aka the gopher state, Kyle laid down paint and spun wrenches until design schools eventually led him out to California. After graduating with his Bachelors degree in Industrial Design from San Jose State University, he designed at Lunar and Tandem computers (now HP) respectively. In addition to design partnering, creating and mentoring, Kyle enjoys time with his toys. If it has a motor and can propel you forward, Kyle can tune on it. Truly believing in the action side of action sports, Kyle gets his knees in the breeze as often as life will let him, either tearing up Infineon on his Ducati or snowboarding up in Tahoe.

    name: Sean Missal
    position: Designer
    bio: Sean Missal comes to us from Western Washington University where he earned his Bachelor Degree in Industrial Design. Born in the 90s, Sean is truly a child of the tech age. Sean interned at Astro before we snatched him up full-time, and we’re quite proud with how the young man has turned out. Although relatively new to the commercial design game, Sean is laying down heavy design and knowledge for some of our top clients. Before designing, Sean was a pro-gamer with lighting thumbs and smoldering retinas. We turned that couch loving energy into a take no prisoners design machine. As long as we translate the design briefs into first person shooter scenarios, Sean excels every time.

    bio: While sitting beneath a tree between lectures at France’s Institut Supérieur de Design, Francois was struck on his head by an apple. While rubbing his head, he knew fighting gravity was his true calling and that Astro would be a perfect fit for him, his master’s degree, and snowboard. If you can pry Francois away from his designing tools, you’ll find him hiking, biking or shredding large hills in San Francisco or the nearby Sierras.
