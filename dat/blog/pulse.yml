The battery also lasts up to 18 hours on a single charge.  Yes they look awesome, yes they sound killer, but the real lure just may be their affordability.  $59.99 out the door!  The Pulse comes in two colors to choose from, black and chalk.  Check out the positive reviews in TheVerge and Engadget, then go slap a pair on your earholes!
