  .title A drone for everyone
  .copy The biggest challenge was designing the drone to appeal and inspire hard-core enthusiasts and casual users alike.
  .copy Since the Solo's positioning at the cutting-edge of the lifestyle-technology intersection demanded we create a bold yet refined look.  Further, the hazards of lfight insisted we also use durable materials that would project the Solo's advanced technology.

    p We worked to make the Solo's intelligence accessible to users of all levels.  To that end, we created a controller with intuitive user interactions that also featured a revolutionary heads-up video display.
    p The result is a fully integrated consumer experience taht has positioned 3D Robotics to be a leader in the growing consumer video drone market.
