  description: Coming from a long line of DIY designers, thinkers, and tinkerers, it’s no surprise that we at Astro take Secret Santa serious. After the traditional drawing of co-workers names from a hat, there are only two rules for the gift exchange. Firstly, you can’t make people cry, and secondly no live animals. The gifts often fit into a medium-to-harsh roast type scenario, but not always. Sometimes the gifts are killer hand-made gifts from an awesome person you work with. That’s just the luck of the draw. This was the 21st annual gift exchange, but the first for a good handful of new designers that were indoctrinated.  Always super fun, and Karson in particular can’t wait till next year.
