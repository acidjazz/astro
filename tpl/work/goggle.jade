    .copy The design preserves the EG2's iconic, sharp shape, but removes the lens frame.  allowing the lens to run to the edge for maximum visibility and futuristic the look.  We also designed the EG3 to integrate their signature quick-change lens feature and included details like fading perforations for a totally original result.
