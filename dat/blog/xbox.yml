  description: "It’s with bleary eyes and callused fingers that we heard it was game over for the production of the Xbox360 as of April, 2016. Working on the Xbox360 console, controllers and family of accessories was the start of a long running collaboration between ASTRO and Microsoft. Originally released November 22nd 2005, the Xbox360 has since sold over 84 million units and racked up over 78 billion gaming hours played. It is fantastic to be part of the Xbox legacy, which also arguably set the bar for game controllers to this day (they’re still in production). We’d like to also Hi5 the army of creative people that bled into this product family, it was a great run.
