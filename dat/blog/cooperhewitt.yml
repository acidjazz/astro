  name: Cooper Hewitt National Design Awards 
  description: For our 4th Cooper Hewitt National Design Awards nomination, we set out to show our history of creating products that live at the center of tech and consumer lifestyles; a history of tapping into American pop culture and designing products that change the way people think. The book we put together does just that, and with a nod to our team in the trenches everyday. <p>Congratulations to the winners of this yearâ€™s CHNDA!
