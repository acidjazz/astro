  description: Ahhh, Snowcation! Check out the snowboard selfie-stick goPro skills of our designer Francois. We had a blast rolling up to Tahoe. Most of our crew will probably remember the snowy peaks atop Heaveny, but I’m not sure what I’ll remember most. Will I remember the snow, the fish tacos, pool sharking, relaxing, hiking, thrift shopping, or the persistent rash on my leg from the hot tub? I guess it doesn’t really matter, It seems I’m set to remember it all. #snowisdope
