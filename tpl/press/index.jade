      .copy Astro Brings HTC’s Vive Into a New Reality Astro helped HTC create a breakthrough brand for their game-changing Virtual Reality system, Vive. Powered by revolutionary room-scale technology, Vive’s unbounded experience is poised to transform the way we consume content, explore the unknown, and make scientific discoveries. Beginning with a solid strategic foundation, Astro developed Vive’s positioning, logo, and messaging. This gave them the tools they need to be a leader in this emerging sector. The logo symbolizes Vive’s role as a transformational tool. The hard outer triangle represents the technology in Vive, while the organic inner form represents the humanity that makes Vive possible. The tagline, THIS IS REAL, boldly announces Vive’s arrival as a transformative technology that will force us to redefine our idea of reality. Astro also partnered with Optimist Design to bring Vive into the big time, creating an epic brand video that debuted at this year’s CES
