  name: The Sultan of Suave
  description: Recently I attended the Oscar de le Renta exhibit at the San Francisco De Young Museum with my lovely wife and daughter for a grand afternoon of American (via Dominican Republic) fashion history.  ODLR’s genius is on full display in this collection.  We especially enjoyed “The Sultan of Suave’s”  work inspired by thematic locations like Russia, China, Spain, etc. in addition to his bold use of colors, textures, detailing and materials which were amazingly crafted and executed. He often designed for the America’s First Ladies and Hollywood elite, but just as impressive was his work and support for the struggling children of his native Dominican Republic.
