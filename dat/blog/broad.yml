  description: Last week I was in LA and with a few hours to kill and found myself standing in front of a huge honeycomb-like structure. I quickly identified it as The Broad, L.A.'s New Contemporary Art Museum. The museum was designed by Diller Scofidio and Renfro in collaboration with Gensler, and the admission is FREE!
