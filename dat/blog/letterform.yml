  description: The graphics team recently took a quick field trip down to the <a target='_new' href='http://letterformarchive.org/'>Letterform Archive</a>. Located just down the street in Potrero Hill, the Archive is home to a private collection of more than 30,000 typography related books, and ephemera. As designers, we are constantly hungry to learn more about our craft, and this was a great way of doing so. The team was fascinated by the sheer volume of the collection, and the great sense of history of design that lay within the shelves. We had a great time, and recommend the Archive to anyone who loves letters as much as we do!
