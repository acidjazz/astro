    title: STREAMLINED, SLEEK, SECURE
    left: Verifone had long been a leader in point of sale systems, but they were feeling the heat from some new players in the payment game. They came to us to help them design an integrated payment machine for a connected world. We came up with Carbon.
    right: The Verifone Carbon is a two-screen system that’s user friendly for both merchant and customer. The Carbon sits on a base station containing a printer and charges the screen unit so it can also be handheld and wireless. With a sleek design language is a radical departure from bulky cash registers and POS machines that they’re known for, Carbon is a product designed to bring Verifone into the future and keep them at the forefront of the POS industry.
