.copy We created Minus-8 to scratch our entrepreneurial itch and to give ourselves the chance to deisgn for our toughest client: us.

.copy The Minus-8's brand is inspired by California's eight-hour distance from Greenwich Mean Time.  We believe America's West Coast culture gives us the freedom to be innovators and change-agents.  The progressive, layered construtction makes Minus-8 as future-focused in its aesthetic as it is in its ethos.
