                  <div class="summary">Kristy hails from the University of Illinois where she studied Nutrition, but a few rounds at the hospital quickly squashed the Florence Nightingale right out of her. Knowing she needed to be part of a creative scene, she switched gears into Advertising and cut her teeth at a handful of agencies in Chicago and San Francisco. Most recently, she lent her knowledge and calm to Goodby Silverstein &amp; Partners before beaming on to the Astro Mothership where she currently resides. In her spare time, Kristy likes to teach her Chihuahua Rufus to play guitar and she says he’s doing well, although he needs to learn a few more songs...Magaritaville just isn’t cutting it.</div>

                  <div class="summary">University of Cincinnati Bearcat Travis Wettroth earned his BFA in Industrial Design. Travis is one of those designers that has a hard time turning it off, so his downtime isn’t much different than his worktime. When left alone he enjoys improving on his figure drawing and 3D animation. The California DMV is really what drew Travis to settle in the Golden State. Travis loves the departments’s efficiency, and the care given to each motorist. Always learning and honing his skills, Travis’ bag of tricks is growing to Santa Claus proportions.</div>
