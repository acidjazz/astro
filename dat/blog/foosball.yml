  description: Last week, we had a gigantic blast competing with Frog Design in an action-packed foosball tournament here at Astro. If you didn’t know, we take our foosball serious here, or more importantly, we are serious about looking good while playing and winning foosball. We designed our first AFC (Astro Foosball Club) t-shirts and patches, as well as a gold trophy to match. Frog took the bait, I mean accepted our invitation to this evening of foos, brews, pizza and beats. With sheer tenacity and skills, Astro emerged victorious!Mega-good–times! We can’t wait to beat another design group in some sort of amusement game. Snooker, Air Hockey? Pop-A-Shot? Bring it on!
