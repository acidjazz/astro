astro:
  name: Astronaut Mascot
  position: Mascot
  summary: We found Astro on ebay, where he had penned a beautiful pitch requesting aid in his escape from a dank closet in the middle of Wisconsin.

francois:
  name: Francois Dransart
  position: Designer
  summary: While sitting beneath a tree between lectures at France’s Institut Supérieur de Design, Francois was struck on his head by an apple. While rubbing his head, he knew fighting gravity was his true calling and that Astro would be a perfect fit for him, his master’s degree, and his snowboard. If you can pry Francois away from his designing tools you’ll find him hiking, biking or shredding large hills in San Francisco or the nearby Sierras.

andres:
  name: Andrés Quiroz
  position: Lead Designer
  summary: Where to start with a heavy cat like Andrés? He snatched his BFA in graphic design from Cal Poly. He worked his way up from lead onion dicer to Executive Chef in the span of one summer at Taqueria De La Muerte in Stockton CA, and he never once shed a tear. Andrés relies on hustle and pure vision, and sees life through his analog cameras. If he isn’t taking snaps or developing pictures in his dark room, you can find him at Astro leading one of the many graphic or packaging programs.
tom:
  name: Tom Galbraith
  position: Studio Manager
  summary: Tom gets stuff done, isn’t afraid to wear a gorilla suit and heavily contributes to the Astro Blog, marketing materials, and any other content that may come across his desk. He has stepped foot in every state in this great nation of ours, even the ones he didn’t want to visit. Being a musician since birth, Tom turns his Astro duties into rock songs….like “Moving Chairs” or “Ordering Pop Tarts from Costco.” And although the critics love him, he’s been widely ignored by most music listeners.
andy:
  name: Andy Uhm
  position: Senior Designer
  summary: Andy Uhm was born in Seoul, S. Korea. After just one-day waiting tables at Ribs-R-Us, Andy knew schlepping baby back ribs wasn’t for him, and luckily Ribs-R-Us needed their apron back. Andy took to earning his B.S. in Transportation design from the Art Center in Pasadena. Andy wasn’t feeling the car vibe so he started designing products for a handful of startups, and bigger fish. Andy’s creative and curious nature needs a diverse range of projects, so he searched, found, and landed at Astro in SF. Here the design is varied, the surf is cold but doable, and people generally agree that the ribs at Ribs-R-Us are fairly lack luster.

brett:
  name: Brett Lovelady
  position: Founder & CEO
  summary: "Brett is a designer, communicator and angst-ridden creative capitalist. After receiving his BFA in Design at BYU, he escaped to Silicon Valley to design the future. After his successful run as Vice President of Design at Lunar and Frog respectively, he sought absolute power (aka responsibility) and unbridled creative license. This led him to the founding of Astro Studios in 1994, and it’s been a giant fun-filled waterslide of bringing innovative products to market, turning venturous sparks into fireballs, and becoming a global design voice. 

Brett’s favorite pastime is family time with a dash of sports and music to take the edge off. And if he gets the chance, a lap in his classic Mustang ragtop recharges him to pursue the next big thing."

Celeste is a perfect fit for the Astro admin team. Don’t believe me? She actually has wrangled cats. Yep, Celeste worked at a Cat Hotel, keeping the cats and her crazy cat-lady boss in line.

carolyn:
  name: Carolyn Galbraith
  position: Finance Director
  summary: Carolyn’s first job was peddling candy and nuts for the House Of Almonds in San Rafael, and her life has been pretty much uphill since then. After receiving her BA in Theater from UC Santa Cruz, she has quarterbacked the financial role for many diverse companies for over 20 years. Since her arrival at Astro Carolyn has continued in her role of financial steward, as well as quite literally put the human back in Human Resources.

robin:
  name: Robin Stice
  position: Lead Designer
  summary: Robin Stice has a blackbelt in Tae Kwon Do, so we’ve allotted ample room at Robin’s workstation for roundhouse kicks and knee strikes.

sean:
  name: Sean Missal
  position: Designer
  summary: Sean comes to us from Western Washington University where he earned his Bachelor Degree in Industrial Design. Born in the 90s, Sean is truly a child of the tech age. Sean interned at Astro before we snatched him up full-time and we’re quite proud of how the young man has turned out. Although relatively new to the commercial design game, Sean is laying down heavy design and knowledge for some of our top clients. Before designing, Sean was a pro-gamer with lighting thumbs and smoldering retinas. We turned that couch loving energy into a take no prisoners design machine. As long as we translate the design briefs into first person shooter scenarios, Sean excels every time.

kristy:
  name: Kristy Green
  position: Account Manager
  summary: Kristy hails from the University of Illinois where she studied Nutrition, but a few rounds at the hospital quickly squashed the Florence Nightingale right out of her. Knowing she needed to be part of a creative scene, she switched gears into Advertising and cut her teeth at a handful of agencies in Chicago and San Francisco. Most recently, she lent her knowledge and calm to Goodby Silverstein & Partners before beaming on to the Astro Mothership where she currently resides. In her spare time, Kristy likes to teach her Chihuahua Rufus to play guitar and she says he’s doing well, although he needs to learn a few more songs...Magaritaville just isn’t cutting it.
travis:
  name: Travis Wettroth
  position: Designer
  summary: University of Cincinnati Bearcat Travis Wettroth earned his BFA in Industrial Design. Travis is one of those designers that has a hard time turning it off, so his downtime isn’t much different than his worktime. When left alone he enjoys improving on his figure drawing and 3D animation. The California DMV is really what drew Travis to settle in the Golden State. Travis loves the departments’s efficiency, and the care given to each motorist. Always learning and honing his skills, Travis’ bag of tricks is growing to Santa Claus proportions.
