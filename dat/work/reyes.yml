    title: Performance meets fashion.
    left: Competitve riders need high-performance eyewear, but fashion-conscious cyclists don’t want to wear something too aggressively styled. What’s a serious biker who cares about their kit to wear? And so our challenge was clear. Design premium crafted technologically advanced performance frames that bridge the gap between fashion and sport.
    right: Reyes eyewear concepts take styling, material and manufacturing cues from luxury eyewear. This approach produces the rigorous technical specs required by competitive cyclists and opens up the design palette to satisfy the demands of fashion conscious riders. We designed Reyes eyewear to meet a rigorous set of material and design requirements, so that they work great on race day and look great at the cafè.
