    title: We speak dog.
    left: The American Kennel Club has been a trusted authority on dog care, training, and pretty much everything else canine for over 130 years. They developed the Link AKC Smart Collar as a tool to help dog owners build a better, closer relationship with their dogs. AKC came to us to design a collar that was as dog-friendly as them, and adjustable enough to fit on dogs of all sizes. Sleek lines and organic curves position the smart collar on the cutting edge while also showing an understanding of the needs of the wearer.
    right: The product is rounded out with a charging station and adjustable leather carrier strap that come together for a complete system.The weighted razor and handmade badger brush are housed within a nickel-plated arm and metal stand that's designed to proudly display these carefully designed pieces and stand the test of time.
