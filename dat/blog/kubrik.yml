  description: Get down to the Stanley Kubrick exhibit at the Contemporary Jewish Museum before it’s gone! As a fan of movies, it was awesome to see artefacts from great films such as 2001; A Space Odyssey, The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket, Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. As a designer, I loved getting a glimpse into his process as a filmmaker. From scripts, to storyboards, to sketches, to scale models-- seeing how he created his vision was amazing. <p>As an artist, it was humbling to see the full breadth of Kubrick’s work. I was impressed to see what he accomplished from the time he first published photography at age 17 to his death in 1999, just four days after delivering the final cut of Eyes Wide Shut.</p><p>Check the exhibit out before it closes on October 30th!</p><p>We forgot to take photos of the exhibit, but fortunately Adam Savage gives a really good breakdown of the exhibit on youtube!
