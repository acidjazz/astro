  name: Shinola launches turntables
  description: As the way we consume music continues to evolve from analog to digital to streaming and beyond, listening to a favorite song on vinyl can’t be beat. Our friends at Shinola know this, and recently launched the latest in the audio space—turntables. The new high quality turntables are a combination of wood and steel materials, and fit perfectly into Shinola’s modern American aesthetic.<p>Congratulations to Shinola on the launch! We had a great time collaborating on this project, and can’t wait to hear our favorite album played on one of these (Purple Rain, probably).<p>Check out more <a target='_new' href='https://www.shinola.com/audio.html?gclid=CPGcqa3vj9ACFVSSfgodUjQDxQ'>here</a>.
