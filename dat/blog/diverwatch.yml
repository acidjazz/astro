  name: MINUS-8 Launches new DIVER watch
  description: Astro born watch brand, MINUS-8, is launching the new DIVER watch on Indiegogo starting November 1st. We’ve been working on the DIVER in the studio for about two years, and are excited to finally bring it to the world. Not your average dive watch, DIVER is a bold take on the future of performance watch piece. Drawing its inspiration from the rugged, design-forward West Coast time zone (Minus -8 Greenwich Time), DIVER is our latest, most ambitious high-performance timepiece yet. We put hundreds of hours into developing a fresh, futurist-machine aesthetic that any watch aficionado would appreciate.<p>The Minus-8 Diver is powered by a fully automatic Seiko movement, it’s waterproof up to 300 meters, and has a helium-release valve for smooth surfacing under extreme conditions. The 44 millimeter case is crafted from ultralight, ultra-strong titanium and features a screw down crown for maximum durability. The dial is designed for maximum visibility in all light conditions and is protected by scratch-resistant sapphire crystal that’s second only to diamond in its hardness. The DIVER is completed with a lightweight, corrosion-resistant titanium bracelet in two finishes; Matte Black and Matte Silver.</p><p>The DIVER is available on Indiegogo at a discount through December.
