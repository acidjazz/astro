      p Astro lives in San Francisco, on the fringe of Silicon Valley, where we embrace a design approach that blends lifestyle and technology into relevant, high-performance results.
      p Our approach has enabled us to help our clients and partners transform markets, define pop culture, and generate billions in new revenue.
      p We’ve also collaborated with founders to co-create new companies—and launched, funded, and fueled a few of our own along the way.
      p For over 20 years, our deeper, entrepreneurial approach has paid dividends beyond our wildest imagination and now informs us as we continuously design what’s next.
