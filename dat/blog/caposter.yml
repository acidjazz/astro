  description: We are super psyched to receive this new poster from Aaron Draplin and his Draplin Design Company from Portland OR. Astro is logo-checked in Draplin’s homage to the behemoth that is California. In this print titled California Compiled, Astro shares real estate with the likes of WD-40, Bigfoot, Thrasher Magazine and Pavement. We would like to thank Aaron for including us in this killer poster. Get one of these mega-rare posters for your wall <a target='_new' href='http://www.draplin.com/1998/01/ddc089_california_compiled_poster.html'>here</a>. California dreaming indeed!
